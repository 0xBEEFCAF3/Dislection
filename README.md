# Dislection

A small firefox extension to convert all fonts in the DOM to one tailored for Dyslexic readers. Dislection is part of a larger effort to bring accessibility to the web. I plan to extend the extension to dynamically change text-based content on the web to fit a specific readers needs. There is more research that needs to be done into how we exactly quantify good reading and what properties of text and/or web-page we change in order to better reading.
